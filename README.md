# Androidmeda

Androidmeda is an LLM tool designed to deobfuscate Android application code and find vulnerabilities by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). It analyzes decompiled Android source code to identify obfuscated patterns, suggest more readable names for variables, methods, and classes, and ultimately provide a clearer understanding of an application's logic. 

Android apps generally use Proguard for obfuscating the app and reversing app can be hard with meaning less variable and function names. LLMs seems to do a good job in understanding the context of the code and renaming variables, functions, adding comments etc. (to certain extent but embrace the unpredictibility of it too).

Androidmeda supports both cloud-based LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) and local LLM inference via Ollama, offering flexibility and control over your analysis environment.

Apparently Androidmeda can be used to deobfuscate android malware as well. Some great articles covering it.

## Features

* **LLM-Powered Deobfuscation:** Utilizes advanced LLMs to intelligently deobfuscate code elements and add helpful comments. 
* **Local Model Support:** Seamless integration with local LLMs via Ollama for privacy-focused and cost-effective analysis.
* **API Model Support:** Compatibility with popular LLM APIs for broader model access.
* **Vulnerability Reporting:** Generates reports highlighting potential vulnerabilities found during the analysis.

## Description

Input - Takes decompiled code directory as an input.

Output -

1) * **Vulnerability Report:** A JSON file with name "vuln_report" summarizing identified vulnerabilities.
2) * **Deobfuscated Code:** If `--save_code true` was used, Deobfuscates each file for easier readability and save it in package directory structure for manual reviews. Additionally, labels any security issues seen in the generated code with #SECURITY-ISSUE.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone [https://github.com/In3tinct/Deobfuscate-android-app.git](https://github.com/In3tinct/Deobfuscate-android-app.git)

### 2. Install dependencies 

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Decompile APK

Get the APK of the intended app. And You can use jadx [https://github.com/skylot/jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) to decompile.
It will create a "resources" and "sources" directory. "Sources" directory is where the decompiled .java files sit.

`jadx androidapp.apk`

### 4. Run the script 

**a. Using Google/Anthropic/OpenAI LLM Models.**

`EXPORT API_KEY= "Your API Key"`

You can get the API key for Google [gemini](https://ai.google.dev/), OpenAI [chatgpt](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), Anthropic [claude](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)

To Run script with Public LLM APIs, 

Gemini - `python3 androidmeda.py --llm_provider google --llm_model gemini-1.5-flash -output_dir /tmp/ver/ -source_dir "input_dir1/ input_dir2/"`

ChatGPT - `python3 androidmeda.py --llm_provider openai --llm_model gpt-4.1 -output_dir /tmp/ver/ -source_dir "input_dir1/ input_dir2/"`

**b. Using Ollama open source models to run locally.**

Follow steps here to download and run the model locally [github.com/ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) 

* **Warning: Resource Intensity!** LLM models are large (several GBs) and require significant RAM.
  * **7B models (e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`):** Minimum 8GB RAM, 16GB recommended.
  * **13B models:** Minimum 16GB RAM, 32GB recommended.
  * **33B models:** Minimum 32GB RAM, 64GB recommended.
  Ensure your system (or WSL instance) has sufficient free memory.

To Run script with Ollama, 

`python3 androidmeda.py --llm_provider ollama --llm_model llama3.2 -output_dir /tmp/ver/ -source_dir "input_dir1/ input_dir2/"`

**Parameters -** 

*-llm_provider* is the LLM provider of the model. e.g. google, anthropic, openaI, ollama 

*-llm_model* is the LLM model to use, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT are supported. You can get the model variants from here. 
[google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini#model-variations)
[openai](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-names)
[anthropic](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)

*-output_dir* is the output directory you want to save generated files.

*-source_dir* is the source directory for the decompiled code. You can send more than one directory separated by space as above.

*-save_code* (optional) Default is false. if set as True, it will deobfuscate the code and save in the output directory provided, otherwise only vuln_report file will be generated.

**Important - Don't send the entire package at once which would contain libraries etc. Otherwise It may take forever to scan. Send the specific directories as input which contains app specific code. For example - if package directory looks like com/google/android/yourapp, send com/google/android/yourapp/receivers/**
